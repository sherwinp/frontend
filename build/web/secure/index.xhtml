            <b>Combined Federal State Filing Program Enhances Validation Process</b>
            <p>The Combined Federal State Filing Program was established to simplify reporting of Information Returns to participating states. Due to increased concerns over proper disclosure of information, the Information Reporting Program is enhancing the validation process of combined federal/state data.
            </p>
            <p>
                To ensure that your files are accurate, we encourage all participants to send a test file annually prior to submitting your original information returns. IRS will accept test files electronically through the FIRE System from November 1 through February 15.
            </p>
            <p>
                For additional information on the Combined Federal/State Filing Program, submitting test files, or becoming a new participant in the program refer to Publication 1220, Specifications for Filing Forms 1098, 1099, 5498 and W-2G Electronically.

            <b>File Size</b>
            <p>
                This system is only capable of accepting a file with up to approximately 5 million records (at 750 bytes per record).  We encourage you to compress the file using PKZIP, or WINZIP compression methods.  At 92% compression, this equates to a file size of approximately 330 MB.  If you have files larger than this, please call us at 1-866-455-7438 for specific instructions.

            <b>REPLACEMENT or CORRECTION FILES</b>
            If you have sent an original or correction file and FILE STATUS indicates the file is bad, you must send the corrected file as a replacement file, not a correction or original. If you are still confused, please call us toll free at 1-866-455-7438.
