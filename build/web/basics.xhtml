                    <p>Your browser must be set to receive 'cookies'. Cookies are used to preserve your User ID status.</p>
                    <p>Enable JavaScript or JScript depending on which browser you are using. If you do not enable these components, some features of this system may not work properly for you.</p>

                    <p>The FIRE web site uses temporary session "cookies" to give users a single, uninterrupted session when they are online. FIRE requires that you use a "cookie"-enabled browser when you are within the secured area of the web site. This enables you to move from one secure section to another without having to stop and re-enter your identifying data (such as username and password). This temporary session "cookie" contains a system-generated session ID only and is immediately deleted upon leaving the site.</p>

                    <p>We also monitor network traffic to identify unauthorized attempts to upload or change information or otherwise cause damage to the web service. We focus on web site security so that this service remains available to you and other visitors. No attempts are made to identify individual users unless illegal behavior is suspected.</p>

<p>Any information we collect and maintain in the course of responding to you will be handled in accordance with the access and privacy protection requirements of the Privacy Act.</p>
